# Saved Browser for Reddit
Looking at your saved posts on Reddit can be a major pain - there's no (good) way to filter by subreddit or keyword. This site makes browsing your saved contents on reddit a much more pleasant experience. 

Plus, you can back up your saved submissions to your computer, and import them into the viewer later (just in case you accidentally unsave something or a post gets deleted). 

### Privacy concerns
To be clear, none of your reddit information is saved anywhere but in your own browser. You can clear this data by logging out, or by manually clearing your local and session storage.
